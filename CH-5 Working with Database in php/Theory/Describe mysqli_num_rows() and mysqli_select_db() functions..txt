### `mysqli_num_rows()`

- **Purpose:** Counts the number of rows returned by a `SELECT` query in MySQL.
- **Usage:** After executing a `SELECT` query using `mysqli_query()`.
- **Syntax:** `mysqli_num_rows($result);`
  - `$result`: Result set object returned by `mysqli_query()`.
- **Return Value:** Returns the number of rows in the result set.
- **Example:**
  ```php

  echo "Number of customers: " . $num_rows;
  ```

### `mysqli_select_db()`

- **Purpose:** Specifies which MySQL database to use for subsequent queries.
- **Usage:** To switch between databases or set the active database.

- **Return Value:** Returns `true` on success, `false` on failure.
- **Example:**
  ```php
  $conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "password");

  ```

### Key Points:
- **`mysqli_num_rows()`:** Counts rows in a result set after executing a `SELECT` query.
- **`mysqli_select_db()`:** Sets the active database for subsequent MySQL operations in PHP.

These functions are fundamental for handling and managing MySQL databases efficiently in PHP scripts, providing essential functionalities for data retrieval and database interaction.
